### 1. pointer to pointers

```c++
int* p -> pointer
int** p -> pointer to pointer
int*** p -> pointer to pointer to pointer
```

and so on...

```c++
char** argv == char* argv[]
```

-> equivalent

---

### 2. type union

```c++
union Vars {
    double a;
    int b;
    char c[7];
}
```

-> a type of structure

- used where the amount of memory used is a key factor

- contains all possible data types

- useful when the type of data being passed through functions is unknown

#### Example in GeeksforGeeks

##### Source : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/structures-unions-and-enumerations-in-cpp/

```c++
// C++ program to illustrate the use
// of the unions
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Defining a Union
union GFG {
    int Geek1;
    char Geek2;
    float Geek3;
};

// Driver Code
int main()
{
    // Initializing Union
    union GFG G1;

    G1.Geek1 = 34;

    // Printing values
    cout << "The first value at "
         << "the allocated memory : " << G1.Geek1 << endl;

    G1.Geek2 = 'G';

    cout << "The next value stored "
         << "after removing the "
         << "previous value : " << G1.Geek2 << endl;

    G1.Geek3 = 34.34;

    cout << "The Final value value "
         << "at the same allocated "
         << "memory space : " << G1.Geek3 << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Output :
The first value at the allocated memory : 34  
The next value stored after removing the previous value : G  
The Final value value at the same allocated memory space : 34.34

Explanation: In the above code, Geek2 variable is assigned an integer (34). But by being of char type, the value is transformed through coercion into its char equivalent (â€œ). This result is correctly displayed in the Output section.

### 3. auto

```c++
auto& trace(bool value = true) {
    m_trace = value;
    return *this;
}
```

-> useful when we do not know the return type

---

### 4. Singleton Class

-> a special type of class

- can have only one object/instance at a time
- = can instantiate only one instance of the singleton class

---

To make a singleton class :

_1. make all constructors private_ -> an instance cannot be created outside of the class

_2. delete the copy constructor_ -> prevent copies

_3. make a private ***static*** pointer that points to the single instance_ -> cannot access it outside of the class directly

_4. make a public ***static*** method that returns the pointer to the single instance_ -> = The only way to access the instance outside of the class

##### -> by making the pointer & method static, we can track the number of instance created in this program (if already created once, it will stop making it by the if statement)

---

ex.

```c++
#include <iostream>

class Logger {
public:
    // Function to get the instance of the Logger class.
    static Logger& getInstance() {
        // Check if an instance already exists, and create one if not.
        if (!instance) {
            instance = new Logger;
        }
        return *instance;
    }

    // Log a message to the console.
    void log(const std::string& message) {
        std::cout << "Log: " << message << std::endl;
    }

private:
    // Private constructor to prevent external instantiation.
    Logger() {
        // Constructor code here.
    }

    // Private destructor to prevent deletion through pointers.
    ~Logger() {
        // Destructor code here.
    }

    // Private copy constructor and assignment operator to prevent cloning.
    Logger(const Logger&) = delete;
    Logger& operator=(const Logger&) = delete;

    // Private static instance pointer.
    static Logger* instance;
};

// Initialize the static instance pointer to nullptr.
Logger* Logger::instance = nullptr;

int main() {
    Logger& logger1 = Logger::getInstance();
    Logger& logger2 = Logger::getInstance();

    logger1.log("This is a log message from logger1.");
    logger2.log("This is a log message from logger2.");

    // Both logger1 and logger2 refer to the same Logger object.

    return 0;
}
```

Output:  
Log: This is a log message from logger1.  
Log: This is a log message from logger2.

ex2.
Professor's code :

```c++
Tracer& tracer = Tracer::instantiate();
Tracer& Tracer::instantiate( ){
    static Tracer T;
    return T;
}
Tracer& Tracer::trace(bool value){
    m_trace = value;
    return *this;
}
const Tracer& Tracer::operator<<(const char* message){
    if (m_trace) cout<< (message ? message : "NULL");
    return *this;
}
const Tracer& Tracer::operator<<(int val)const{
    if (m_trace) cout << val;
    return *this;
}
```

### 5. casting

- in c -> int i = (int) ch;
- in c++ -> int i = int (ch);

---

### 6. Move

-> my understanding : sort of cut & paste (copy, paste, and delete the original) + original stays in place but becomes null inside

- can be applied to variables and class instances
