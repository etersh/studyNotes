-- Grouping and Aggregate Functions
-- **********************************

-- aggregate functions are also called multi-line functions
-- aggregate function -> group function

-- ORDER of Coding
/*
 - SELECT ,comma separated fieldlist>
 - FROM <data sources with/without JOINs>
 - WHERE <conditional statements, boolean expressions>
 - GROUP BY <comma separated fieldlist>
 - HAVING <conditional statements, boolean expressions>
 - ORDER BY <comma separated fieldlist>
*/

-- ORDER of Execution
/*
1 - FROM with JOINs
2 - WHERE - eliminates as much data as BEFORE grouping (no aggregate functions)
3 - GROUP BY - separate into smaller groups
4 - HAVING - filtering data AFTER grouping (includes aggregate functions)
5 - SELECT as a loop
6 - ORDER BY
*/

/*
There are 7 aggregate functions
-- SUM
-- COUNT
-- AVG
-- MIN
-- MAX
-- VAR - variance
-- STDDEV - standard deviation
*/

-- Example
-- How countries are in the database?
-- > we should get this value electronically (not counting manually)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM countries;
-- but we don't need to grab all
-- instead, we can just grab 1 column and count how many rows
SELECT COUNT(country_id) FROM countries;
-- grab primary key only

-- the above has limitations

-- how many countries are there in each region?
SELECT *
FROM countries
ORDER BY region_id; -- bad for larger datasets

-- Grouping (Group By) - !!! never use * in grouping!!!
SELECT
    region_id,
    COUNT(country_id) AS numCountries
FROM countries
GROUP BY region_id
ORDER BY region_id;

-- Having - has to be after grouping!

-- same question, but only show regions with more than 5 countries
SELECT
    region_id,
    COUNT(country_id) AS numCountries
FROM countries
GROUP BY region_id
HAVING COUNT(country_id) > 5 -- SELECT executes after, so we cannot put numCountries
ORDER BY region_id;

-- same question but do not include region 3
SELECT
    region_id,
    COUNT(country_id) AS numCountries
FROM countries
WHERE region_id <> 3 -- != is not universal, so use universal <>
GROUP BY region_id
HAVING COUNT(country_id) > 5
ORDER BY region_id;
-- if it has aggregate function, put it in the HAVING
-- if not, in WHERE

-- -----------------------------------------------------------
-- example
-- what is the total salary in each department?
-- sort this from most expensive to least expensive
SELECT
    e.department_id,
    department_name, -- we cannot select the ones that weren't grouped
    SUM(salary) AS totalSalary
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY e.department_id, department_name -- "each" & "per" means we have to group
ORDER BY totalSalary DESC;

-- Professor Clint's Law
/* 
Any field included in the SELECT clause, not included in an aggregate function,
MUST BE in the GROUP BY clause.
*/

-- How many employees work in each country?
-- EVEN THOUGH the question doesn't include "ALL EMPLOYEES", make sure to cover all employees
SELECT
    c.country_id,
    country_name,
    COUNT(employee_id) AS numEmps
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
LEFT JOIN locations l ON d.location_id = l.location_id
LEFT JOIN countries c ON l.country_id = c.country_id
GROUP BY c.country_id, country_name
ORDER BY country_name;

-- What is the annual INCOME for employees in each department
-- > means total income of all employees, not individual
-- NOTE: INCOME = SALARY + COMMISSION
-- COMMISSION = commission_pct * salary
-- (usually commission is based on sales, but we don't have it in our table)
SELECT
    department_name,
    SUM(12 * (salary + NVL(salary, 0) * NVL(commission_pct, 0))) AS totalIncome -- NVL replaces null values with second argument
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY e.department_id, department_name -- if the department name is same, we can distinguish by primary key (id)
ORDER BY department_name;

-- how does aggregate functions handle null values
-- using commission_pct to figure this out

SELECT COUNT(commission_pct) FROM employees;
-- doesn't count null

SELECT COUNT(NVL(commission_pct, 0)) AS numEmps FROM employees;
-- counts null

-- What is the average commission percent for employees
SELECT AVG(commission_pct) AS avgCom
FROM employees;

SELECT AVG(NVL(commission_pct, 0)) AS avgCom
FROM employees;

-- DISTINCT
-- How many departments have employees?

-- WRONG CODE
SELECT COUNT(department_id) AS numDepts -- will count duplicates also
FROM employees;
-- kimberly grant is missing
-- not distinct departments (double counting)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) AS numDepts
FROM employees;
-- still no kimberly grant

-- CORRECT CODE
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT NVL(department_id, 0)) AS numDepts
FROM employees;
```
