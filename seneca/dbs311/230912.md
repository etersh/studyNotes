/* JOINS
INNER, LEFT OUTER, RIGHT OUTER, FULL OUTER

Notes: 
= JOINs are NOT relationships
- JOINs have no knowledge that relationships exists
- ANSI92 JOINs use the JOIN keyword
- ANSI89 JOINs are NOT ACCEPTABLE
    - you will receive 0
    
example of ANSI89
SELECT fields
FROM table1, table2
WHERE table1.fields 1 = table2.field2;


----------------------------------
-- ORDER OF EXECUTION

-- 1. FROM with JOINS/ON/USING
-- 2. WHERE
-- 3. GROUP BY -- next week
-- 4. HAVING -- next week
-- 5. SELECT as a loop
-- 6. ORDER BY

you write the SQL statement.

-- is same as
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    city
FROM
    locations l
    JOIN departments d ON l.location_id = d.location_id
    -- LEFT, RIGHT, FULL JOIN ALL HAVE THE SAME RESULT, BUT ONLY INNERJOIN IS CORRECT
    -- when there are multiple joins, it goes by order. ex. A join B right join C -> A+B->D result: D+C 
    RIGHT JOIN employees e ON e.department_id = d.department_id
ORDER BY
    UPPER(last_name),
    UPPER(first_name);

    This wouldn't work because in USING, department_id get merged

-- USINGS are perfectly fine for INNERJOINs. works same.
-- but for OUTERJOINs, it is unpredictable. Values might be different.
-- SO NEVER USE USING FOR OUTERJOINS (OR DO NOT USE IT FOR EVERYTHING)


------------------------------------------------
-- INVERSE or NEGATIVE JOINS

-- ex. list all employees who are NOT associated with a city
