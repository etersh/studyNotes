```sql
-- Examples :
-- List all employees!
SELECT * FROM employees;
-- * does NOT mean all data - * means all columns
-- There is no WHERE that indicates all rows

-- list all employees as a contact list (last name, first name)

SELECT
    employee_id,
    last_name || ', ' || first_name AS fullName,
    -- do not put double quotes (ex. "fullName) unless it is mandatory
    -- (will have to put it everytime)
    phone_number,
    email,
    job_id AS jobTitle
FROM employees
ORDER BY
    UPPER(last_name),
    UPPER(first_name);

-- second sorting only happens when the first one has duplicates (barely happens)
-- always check that everything is uppercase or lowercase

-- double quotes are identifiers (object names) - only use when there is a space in the string
-- single quotes are literals (just string)

-- distinct keyword
-- list all the job titles and the employeeid whom managers them

SELECT DISTINCT
    job_id,
    manager_id
FROM employees
ORDER BY job_id;

-- aliases and their use
-- column aliases and table aliase

SELECT DISTINCT
    e.job_id AS jobTitle,
    manager_id
FROM employees e
WHERE e.job_id='IT_PROG'
ORDER BY e.job_id;

-- The reason why this does not work
/*
SELECT DISTINCT
    job_id AS jobTitle,
    manager_id
FROM employees e
WHERE jobTitle = 'IT_PROG'
ORDER BY e.job_id;
*/
-- in the WHERE clause, jobTitle is not created yet because of order of execution

-- Order of execution
-- 1) FROM with JOIN
-- 2) WHERE
-- 3) SELECT as a LOOP
-- 4) ORDER BY

-- WEEK 3 ORDER OF EXECUTION
-- 1) FROM with JOIN
-- 2) WHERE
-- 3) GROUP BY
-- 4) HAVING
-- 5) SELECT as a LOOP
-- 6) ORDER BY

-- dates and human interaction (TO_DATE() and TO_CHAR())
-- dates are easy to use in computers but not between a computer and human
-- in computer -> dates do not exist (

-- example - what date is 04/05/06 ???
-- April 5, 2006
-- May 4, 2006
-- May 6, 2004
-- ????

-- find all employees hired after May 6, 1995
SELECT
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    TO_CHAR(hire_date,'Month dd, yyyy') AS hireDate
    -- 'month dd, yyyy' -> ex. august 10
    -- 'Month dd, yyyy' -> ex. August 10
    -- 'Mon dd, yyyy' -> ex. Aug 10
FROM employees
WHERE
    hire_date > TO_DATE('05-06-1995','mm-dd-yyyy')
ORDER BY hire_date;

-- This would not work because the computer does not understand 95
-- and the time setting will be different for every computer
/*
SELECT
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE
    hire_date > '05-06-95'
ORDER BY hire_date;
*/

-- Case Sensitivity
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY last_name;
-- fix this by
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY UPPER(last_name);

-- find all employees whose last name starts with ~
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE UPPER(last_name) LIKE 'E%'
-- by UPPER, last names like ernst will appear too. (be aware of cases)
ORDER BY UPPER(last_name);

-- starts with 'e%'
-- ends with '%e'
-- contains '%e%'

-- parameters
-- list all employees whose last name starts with a string entered by the user
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE UPPER(last_name) LIKE UPPER('&letter%')
ORDER BY UPPER(last_name);
