-- Sub-Queries (Nested Queries)
-- ***************************

-- Types of Queries
-- TABULAR - returns a table with rows and columns (ALL queries are tables)
-- LIST    - returns a SINGLE column, with any number of rows
-- SCALAR  - returns a SINGLE value (one row, one column)
--         - GUARANTEED to be a single value

-- list the deparmentIDs in location 1700
SELECT department_id
FROM departments
WHERE location_id = 1700;
-- NOT scalar, more than one row (location_id is not the PK)

SELECT city
FROM locations
WHERE location_id = 1800;
-- SCALAR, guaranteed one value as location_id in WHERE is PK

-- scalar example
SELECT COUNT(player_id) AS numPlayers
FROM players;

/*
why does it matter
- anything to the right of an "=" sign MUST be a scalar.
    WHERE a = b -> b must be scalar
        note: with NULL we use IS, not = (IS NOT NULL, NOT IS NULL)
- anything in an IN(), ALL(), or ANY() function must be a list
    WHERE location_id IN (10,20,50,70)
-- anything in the FROM clause is a table.
*/

-- example
-- List the departmentIDs in location 1700
SELECT department_id
FROM departments
WHERE location_id = 1700;

-- example
-- What was the most goals scored by a single player in a single game?
SELECT max(numGoals) AS maxGoals
FROM goalscorers;
-- returns a 5

-- but who scored those goals
SELECT playerid
FROM goalscorers
WHERE numGoals = 5;
-- returns 2190470

-- but what is their name?
SELECT
    firstname,
    lastname
FROM players
WHERE playerID = 2190470;

-- but what if someone scores 6 tomorrow?
SELECT playerid
FROM goalscorers
WHERE numGoals = (
    SELECT MAX(numGoals) AS maxGoals
    FROM goalscorers
    );
    
SELECT
    firstname,
    lastname
FROM players
WHERE playerID IN (
    SELECT playerid
    FROM goalscorers
    WHERE numGoals = ( -- doesn't guarantee a single value, so should use WHERE playerID "IN"
        SELECT MAX(numGoals) AS maxGoals
        FROM goalscorers
        )
    );
